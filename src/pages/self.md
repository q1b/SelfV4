### Introduction to myself

Born in India, dreaming about the stars in night and living with the nature in day is what was my routine in my childhood playing, and doing all that childish stuff, until I was 6, then school started and I went to school, There I find Maths interesting and When get Introduced to Science in 6th standard Science also become favorite Now, comming in class 7th. I was pretty average student, then My parents decided to send me to hostel. where I was in a completely out of comfort situtation as well learn how to survive, by myself. although My parent come to me 2 to 3 times to visit me. But still I learned The potensial lies within me, So in one year I come in top 3 students in my school along with I started playing basketball, Basketball become a passion at that point of time. I play almost 3 to 4 hours in regular days as well when there is holidays I can play for 7 to 8 hours, I done practice but Injuries always slow down the process of my mastering basketball. In next 3 years, mainly I learned how to play basketball and Do my studies. Now nothing great, I left hostel in my 11standard and went back home, then in Covid time I utilize it to make my future bright, I used to do meditation as well
