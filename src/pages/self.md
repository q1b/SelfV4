# Birth is Interesting
Date on which I was born is 5th september, 2003 and it's a special day in India celebrated as teachers'day, along with that there is a coincidence that my both parents are teachers, My father is english teacher and My mother teachs Maths. But along with that My Grandfather is also a teacher that quite rare, Same time this all secenario are serendipity for me.

## As a normal kid 4-12
I was bit more curious about surrounding than other kids are, asking about body, sky, star, from parents that not result into solution and So, those question are still mistery for me and going into why this and that some how helped me a lot in understanding Maths and Physics, when I got introduced to these subjects later in my high school, but yeah I have to do little efforts to understand some concepts which takes much more time for others to understand. 

## Now a Young boy,
This time I was pretty average student, then My parents decided to send me to **hostel**. where I was in a *completely out of comfort situtation* as well ***learn*** *how to survive*, by myself. although My parent come to me 2 to 3 times to visit me. But still I learned The potensial lies within me, So in one year I come in top 3 students in my school along with I started playing basketball, Basketball become a passion at that point of time. I play almost 3 to 4 hours in regular days as well when there is holidays I can play for 7 to 8 hours, I done practice but Injuries always slow down the process of my mastering basketball. In next 3 years, mainly I learned how to play basketball and Do my studies. Now nothing great, I left hostel in my 11standard and went back home, then in Covid time I utilize it to make my future bright, I used to do meditation as well

## Lockdown 2020-2021
lifechanging events, because I got interested in learning about making real life things for the world which made me very wild in the sense that I now used to spend more time on laptop, I purchaced Flutter & Dart Udemy course followed everything but lacked the funcdamentals of programming So, I spliped off from there and landed into learning html, CSS. because html and CSS is lot more easier for a person like me to learn, then spend 2 months learning it as well learned tailwindcss along with them in 2months. that's a lot progress for someone like me without any mentor or guide. I am very grateful for the time being in favour of me as well my parental support that made me that flexible to do multiple things at same time.

## Learning Js, CSS
Yeah bit hard to learn things after things as you things why to learn more things when you can do things with things already availables there, So I learned more and more things.
