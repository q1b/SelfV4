Before 2020, we can say that officies, infrastruture that we brought, build or make
our value in world because they matter,
but after 2021, business, companies and people are looking for websites that are
just look awesome and easy to work with, So I take a insiation that I make website
which look awesome as well easy to scale, for future, --

I am familiar with [HTML](ht) CSS Javascript Typescript Stencil React Vue and Svelte,
Tailwindcss Pug So, I just like covered a lot of things above but

I learned a thing from learning these,

Care about how the end result is going to look in front-end,
Learn CSS, learn some basics of javascript, then make projects learn from them,
invoke ideas and research on how you can achieve that as well if that idea need
more technologies then you learn then try to skip it for now or If you can afford
learning those technologies and think that they are going to help you in future then
go for them.

> Nice to see this But I forget what's it
